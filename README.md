## Overview
COVID-19 is a widespread deadly virus that directly affects the human lungs. The spread of COVID-19 did not stop at humans but also reached animals, so it was necessary to limit it is spread and diagnose cases quickly by applying a quarantine to the infected people. Recently x-ray lung images are used to determine the infection and from here the idea of this research came to use deep learning techniques to analyze x-ray lung images publicly available on Kaggle to possibly detect COVID-19 infection. In this article, we have proposed a method to possibly detect COVID-19 by analyzing the X-ray images and applying a number of deep learning pre-trained models such as InceptionV3, DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG16, and the results are compared to determine the best performance model and accuracy with the least loss for our dataset. Our evaluation results showed that the best performing model for our dataset is ResNet50 with accuracies of 99.99%, 99.50%, and 99.44% for training, validation, and testing respectively followed by DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and finally VGG16.

## Dataset
The dataset that is used in this project is collected from different publicly available sources on Kaggle. After data gathering, several steps to pre-process the data and prepare it for the models are applied. To get the full details of this process, please refer to the paper.
